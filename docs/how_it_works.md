# SpareCodeSearch - How to *search* for *code* context when you do not have a *spare* GPU

Short Answer: All you need is key-word search.

## Introduction
Code Language Models (CLMs) have shown great promise in generating code, given the right contexts in their input prompts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to enhance CLMs by including another module for retrieving relevant context to construct the input prompt.  However, they often require substantial computational resources, making them inaccessible for many users. This project provides a solution that aims to tackle the problem of searching right

## Technical Details
### System Architecture
This project aims to explore efficient methods for searching code without relying on extensive GPU resources. By leveraging keyword-based search techniques, we can provide a lightweight alternative for code context retrieval.
